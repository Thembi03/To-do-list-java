# To-do-list-java
This is the first Java project I did. I wanted to focus on learning to manipulate files.
I did this first project with the sole focus of getting the basics of file handling with Java down, I'll probably do more projects that involved file handling to further my understanding. My initial issue when creating the project was coming up with a suitable structure to display my menu and the data the user stores when the enter their tasks. The next issue was dealing with indexing for each tasks, initially i wanted to include the indexing within the txt file but this came with a host of issues, because whenever i would display each entry the numbers would duplicate each iteration of the loop. This was especially the case when removing tasks. My solution was to use the index of the ArrayList i had created to store the data from the file to get the index printing each task with a corresponding index.
